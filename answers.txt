# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We used the fork() command to implement that parallel upload and dowload. Based on the pid we receive from the forking,
we decide what to do. Previously, it would simply block, but using the event driven approach we make it do the appropriate tast.
The child process will execute the task(download or upload). For eg the client will fork once for every download request,
but if the fork does not succeed, the client won't try to download the new file and will be run again.
We made sure that all downloads finish first by using a blocking model. This ensured that we reclaimed any resources
before we move to uploads and listen for peers. 



# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
Conditions that triggered a buffer overrun are :
1) In static void task_upload(task_t *t)
There is a call to  (osp2p_snscanf(t->buf, t->tail, "GET %s OSP2P\n", t->filename) < 0).
In a snscanf function, the second arguement is the length of the string to be placed 
in the buffer, this could be problematic and cause the buffer overrun because tail t->tail
could be bigger then the allowed legnth
2)In task_t *start_download(task_t *tracker_task, const char *filename) tgere is a call to
strcpy(t->filename, filename). This could potentially be exploited to cause buffer overun.
The strcpy function merely writes the entire string into memory, overwriting whatever 
came after it. Does not matter what the length of the string is.

How did we fix it?
1) By replacing  (osp2p_snscanf(t->buf, t->tail, "GET %s OSP2P\n", t->filename) < 0),
with (osp2p_snscanf(t->buf, FILENAMESIZ-1, "GET %s OSP2P\n", t->filename) < 0).
Now the length of the string is limited by FILENAMESIZ - 1.
2) By replacing strcpy(t->filename, filename) with 
 strncpy(t->filename, filename, FILENAMESIZ-1); 
 t->filename[FILENAMESIZ-1] = '\0';
 The strncpy function truncates the string to the correct 
 length(thus avoiding the buffer overflow), but without the terminating null character.
 Thus we manually added the null character.
