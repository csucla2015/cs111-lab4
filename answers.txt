# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We used the fork() command to implement that parallel upload and dowload. Based on the pid we receive from the forking,
we decide what to do. Previously, it would simply block, but using the event driven approach we make it do the appropriate tast.
The child process will execute the task(download or upload). For eg the client will fork once for every download request,
but if the fork does not succeed, the client won't try to download the new file and will be run again.
We made sure that all downloads finish first by using a blocking model. This ensured that we reclaimed any resources
before we move to uploads and listen for peers. 



# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none
